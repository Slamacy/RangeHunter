# RangeHunter
A basic browser sidescroller made using javascript and canvas html for our 2D Engine Development module.

We made this game according to the specification given to us by a client (who was a student).

Game Created by:
- [Oisin Murphy](https://github.com/Slamacy)
- [Ben Watt](https://www.facebook.com/ben.watt.792)
- [Patricia Bere](https://www.facebook.com/MidgetAssassin)

WE RECOMMEND RUNNING THIS GAME ON FIREFOX
It should work fine for other browsers tht support canvas however.
